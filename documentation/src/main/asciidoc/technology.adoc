== Used Technologies in WMS

In WMS we don't want to reinvent the wheel. So we uses great, reliable frameworks to develop software which fulfills our requirements to 100%.

WMS consists of many libraries which are mostly developed in C++ with the mutliplatform library Qt. So we are able to bring our software on all platforms we need. For interpreting WQL we are using ANTLR. For software development we are using Qt Creator and Visual Studio 64 Bit Compiler. For designing UI's in WMSDP you can use Qt Designer which belongs to the qt-project.

===  WMS Core

==== Planned:

|====
| Feature Name | Description | Priority | Status
| Proxy Container | Developing a special type of container in which you can store proxied objects. A proxy object is a placeholder to a real object in an other objectcontainer | Middle | idea
| AOP | Integrating AOP functionality in WMS calling static aop methods with the functionname and function object as parameter before and after a memberfunction call. This should be defined for all classes for specific classes and for specific members | Middle | idea
| Context Dependency Injection | Defining on container level which member has which value assigning objects automatically to object references and the same with containers. | Middle | idea
| Interfaces | Enable the user to model interfaces | High | in Progress
| Abstract Functions | Enable the user to model abstract functions | Low | idea

| Function overloading | Implement functions with the same name and different arguments | Low | idea
| Const Functions | Implement functions which can be const and they can not modify member data | Low | idea
| Versioning of classes | Versioning of classes and all what belongs to (members, methods, validators,…). To be able to use WMS as repository like SVN or GIT | Low | idea
| Enhancing Logging feature | At the moment you can only define the severity of logging but you can not choose which messages should be logged. This lead to a large number of logging messages in Information or Warning mode which don't want to have. The Idea is to expand the configuration possibilities. Divide system messages from development output, specifying output files and logging modes. | Low | idea
| Defining display format for members | At the moment the member will be displayed dependent of it's type which could be ugly in generic dialogs. For a better user experience user defined formating should be added | Low | idea

| Undo/Redo | Implementing Undo Redo in WMS | Low | idea

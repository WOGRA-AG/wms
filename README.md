# wms WOGRA Modelling System

== Mission of WMS

WOGRA developed WMS to be faster and better in developing software. The aim was to develop a tool which makes software development much faster and is easy to use, powerful enough to fulfill the requirements of our customers and delivers a great user experience. At the moment we target the desktop platform for windows, but it should be compilable on Linux and MacOS as well (not tested).

We developed a modelling tool for data structure (with persistence), data export and import tools, user managers and UI development. This tool is called the WMS Development Platform. To provide each platform with our developed software we developed a runtime which can run on each desktop platform. To make development of methods and functions as simple as possible we integrated JavaScript with additional object oriented features in WMS. 

Another requirement to WMS is that it must be open for enhancements. So we added a powerful plugin mechanism which makes it
possible to develop new data access plugins (e.g. for databases, webservices, nosql and so on) user interfaces and functional
plugins. So everyone uses this platform is free to develop plugins to it.

Since 2011 we use WMS for developing desktop solutions for our customers and the results are breathtaking. We reduced our development time for customer project to maximum 50 - 60% and reduced our error rate dramatically.

== Declarative Development

With WMS, most of coding is declarative. That means that no code is generated or compiled. You interact with wizards and property sheets. If business logic or complex ui are needed, you can write functions of code using object oriented JavaScript. Declarative code yields fewer differences between developers and this consistency makes WMS applications easy to maintain and manage.
